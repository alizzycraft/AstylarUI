# Material audit: evidence-led implementation priorities

This is an audit handoff, not authorization to implement fixes and not a claim
of completed input or output parity. It supplements the detailed
[62-item implementation inventory](material-input-equivalence-audit.md#root-cause-implementation-order).
It does not replace that inventory or drop its lower-priority findings.

The newer public reductions distinguish several independently demonstrated core
defects from Material authoring differences. Those distinctions change the order
of work: do not restore a composition and then tune it around known broken core
contracts, or treat a passing evidence verifier as corrected rendering.

## 1. Preserve real gestures across public updates

**Confirmed in public reductions.** An identical update on the reuse path, or an
unrelated sibling change on the rebuild path, can transfer native focus from the
canvas to its semantic counterpart. Babylon's blur handling then generates a
release while the user still holds the pointer. The core dispatches pointer-up
and, for buttons, premature activation. This is not merely missing active paint.

Owners: core reconciliation, semantic focus synchronization and device-input
integration. The [button causal proof](material-button-held-update-root-cause.md)
pins both paths and actually served instructions; the
[range reduction](material-public-range-drag-audit.md) independently records the
same release path. Preserve keyboard/assistive focus and genuine blur/cancel
semantics. Disabling semantic synchronization, suppressing public updates, or
moving gesture lifetime into the Material plugin is not a correction.

Acceptance for the future fix: replay both existing public matrices, then cover
real cancellation, owner removal/disable/replacement, dragging outside, repeated
updates and multiple surfaces. Verify native events, public events, pressed
identity and held paint at each boundary. Revisit the earlier pointer-focus
finding (inventory item 17) with this evidence; simply removing its transaction
guard could reproduce the proven premature release.

## 2. Route release to the captured owner

**Separately confirmed.** In all 16 no-update public range cases, the gesture
retains capture and native release/change, but release outside the hit target
loses the original owner's public pointer-up. The core runtime dispatches based
on the current hit rather than preserving captured-owner routing.

Owner: core interaction dispatch/capture. Preserve the distinction between
pointer-up delivery, click eligibility and cancellation; do not synthesize a
click whenever a captured gesture ends. Add release over another owner, outside
the surface, cancel/lost-capture and removal cases. Passing update preservation
does not close this independent defect.

## 3. Correct range paint ownership and ordering

**Confirmed for active track/thumb occlusion in the public reduction.** Generic
input material application replaces the range manager's interaction-only
material with an opaque, depth-writing white background. Active track and thumb
depths put them behind that owner and the root for the actual positive-Z camera.
The [passive scene and raster proof](material-public-range-paint-audit.md) retains
all-white candidate crops despite live presentation meshes, without mutating the
public application. Exact coplanar unfilled-track GPU behavior remains unproved.

Owners: core control/material composition and final paint-depth projection.
Define which layer owns the authored background, hit testing and presentation;
make general paint ordering consistent. Do not introduce a Material-only
transparent background, CSS displacement, private depth adjustment or a second
plugin convention. A range-manager-only guard is insufficient if subsequent
generic material application overrides it.

Acceptance: actual visible rasters with opaque ancestors, authored transparent
and opaque backgrounds, opacity zero, stacking, updates, DPR and host movement.
Mesh existence alone is not visibility. This proof does not establish the cause
of the Material black ring or swapped handles, or native range paint parity.

## 4. Share CSS-space range travel geometry

**Confirmed for the captured pointer paths and native appearance.** Independent
native endpoint rasters establish 144px thumb-center travel inside a 160px
control. The core pointer conversion instead divides by the entire 160px width.
The measured model predicts all 256 native moves; all 128 no-update candidate
moves follow the full-width model. Public event-local coordinates already match
the shared CSS coordinates. See the [travel proof](material-public-range-travel-audit.md).

Owners: core range used geometry, pointer mapping and presentation. Derive one
CSS-space travel contract and project only at paint time. Do not hard-code the
observed 8px inset, change step/domain values, or patch world-space coordinates.
Before selecting general metrics, extend width/height, native/custom appearance,
grab position, RTL/vertical, transforms and scroll coverage. This diagnosis is
not universal native thumb sizing or an explanation of overlapping-thumb choice.

## 5. Apply vertical alignment in its CSS formatting context

**Confirmed in the public reduction.** Core `positionTextMesh` interprets
`verticalAlign` as inner-box placement even for block/flex-item/absolute owners,
and approximates baseline as bottom. Explicit baseline and omission disagree
before Babylon projection. The [64-pair proof](material-public-vertical-align-audit.md)
retains 36 failing baseline-relative comparisons and a recording-projection
evaluation of the installed and source methods.

Owners: core formatting-context/line-box layout and text placement. Do not
replace the default with global centering or add text/world-space offsets.
Extend inline siblings, table cells, wrapping and updates. Separately reproduce
the original checkbox/radio/switch label compositions: this core defect is not
yet proved to cause those Material symptoms. In the non-inline reductions,
omission is already vertically correct and adding middle makes it worse.

## 6. Continue the other shared core tracks, not component calibration

The [public cursor reduction](material-public-cursor-defaults-audit.md) adds a
confirmed interaction-boundary defect: explicit resolved default becomes text
when owner-box selection prefers an owned text mesh. Preserve explicit cursor
intent in core pointer resolution. Separately review the documented legacy
button/label pointer defaults against the measured browser baseline. Neither
finding justifies unconditional pointer styles or per-fixture cursor patches.
Recheck actual owner/state targets; one passing family hover probe is insufficient.

Keep the detailed inventory's transform reference-box/units/origin/order,
transformed fixed containing blocks, intrinsic inline sizing, anonymous flex
text, positioned margins/heights, grid-none parsing, computed-font length
resolution, fallback fonts, line boxes and border color/alpha work. Use their
existing minimal proofs and extend composition coverage at the owning boundary.

The calendar span primitive passes; that evidence does not justify calling all
column spans unsupported. Restore and test the actual conditional table/week/
label composition rather than replacing it with manually calculated grid cells.

Input-stage observability is a prerequisite for attribution, not a license to
write a parallel CSS cascade in the harness. Preserve authored requests, local
normal/effective styles, computed/inherited values, used layout and retained
paint as separate evidence stages. The prepared
[72-group alignment/font adapter](material-alignment-font-source-adapter.md) and
[49-group text-alignment proposal](material-text-align-canonical-plan.md) are
classification work, not proof of equal computed values or repaired consumers.

## 7. Restore equivalent Material authoring alongside the owning fixes

Use the historical/input findings to restore the reference contract, not a new
visually calibrated representation. Each restoration needs paired input proof
and a renderer regression test if it exposes a core failure. Specifically:

- Range: restore 0–100/step 5, peer-dependent bounds and hit regions, and remove
  fixed halves and reliance on direct-mesh update bypass. Test both thumbs across
  the midpoint, including start=60/end=80 and start=20/end=40, plus keyboard and
  disabled/hover/held state. Native peer suppression is a separate authoring
  finding; do not assume that it alone diagnoses historical swapped handles.
- Text: restore component tokens, actual child/line-box structure and equivalent
  alignment requests. Remove label-middle and font/spacing substitutions only
  with a proof of the original composition, not a blanket reset.
- Calendar: retain original table/colspan, conditional month-label structure,
  text tokens, vectors, hidden descriptions and focus-reveal close control.
- Options, dialogs, sheets and snackbars: restore original message/action/list/
  label ownership and theme scope before attributing size or baseline symptoms
  to core. Do not copy sampled RGB values or use fixed sizes to simulate tokens.
- Plugin text: remove the competing tab-panel texture/baseline implementation
  in favor of core text ownership. Legitimate Material visuals and state
  orchestration remain plugin work, with CSS geometry and core resource lifetime.

The [slider history](material-slider-input-history.md) records what changed;
historical source facts alone are not browser bisect results or author intent.

## 8. Establish overlay position and lifecycle from authoritative CSS boxes

The connected-overlay path that projects mesh geometry and feeds it back into
authored CSS top is a confirmed ownership violation. Use an existing suitable
public CSS-layout query, or justify an API gap, instead of reusing rendered
output as layout input. Do not repair it with offsets, scale division, a flow
anchor, or plugin-specific world conventions.

**The proposed shared tooltip/snackbar low-position cause is still a hypothesis.**
For each popup, establish equivalent content, state and ancestry first; record
the core CSS box, containing block, scroll/collision decisions, projection,
clipping, paint order and viewport reachability. Distinguish an absent owner from
an off-screen, clipped or occluded owner. Tooltip missing center/wrap/structure
and forced-open benchmark states remain distinct from placement and blur.

Verify first-open/reopen, update, scroll, resize, DPR, real hover/focus/dismissal,
and surface-local modality. Preserve the different datepicker/timepicker focus
contracts. A passing isolated bottom-overlay primitive does not prove the
unequally authored Material bottom sheet, and changing its fixture size is not
a general rendering fix. Keep resource/lifecycle checks separate from rasters.

## 9. Preserve asymmetric borders in natural flow before removing sort paint substitution

The [complete sort structure review](material-sort-focus-structure.md) verifies
60 original cases. In eight focus cases, the reference paints an in-flow bottom
border while the candidate paints a separate absolute child under a fixed-height
relative host. State agreement does not justify that structural translation.
Commit `994da86b` introduced the host position and paint child together, but its
motivation has not been demonstrated.

The [equal-input public reduction](material-sort-focus-border-public-proof.md)
now reproduces a related core failure at two widths in two independent browser
runs: adding a 1px bottom border leaves the candidate flex owner and ancestor
1px too short, leaves the following sibling 1px too high, and shifts the content
up 0.5px. Initial and restored zero-border geometry matches. Normal/effective
style inspection retains the border request; the exact internal causal path
after that stage remains to be traced. Both browser runs fail unchanged
expectations, rather than accepting the current incorrect output.

Owner: core asymmetric border contribution, intrinsic/automatic flex sizing and
cross-axis positioning. The follow-up extracted-method proof demonstrates that
`calculateIntrinsicContainerHeight` in both repository and installed sources
doubles the first border-width scalar, losing bottom-only width and doubling
top-only width. This matches the public failure but is not yet its full runtime
call trace. Trace the reproduction through the actual installed path and
investigate cross-axis displacement separately. Also clarify the public catalog's
precise border-width value subset.

Future acceptance: preserve the public reduction, add text and real focus-state
coverage, verify border raster separately, then restore the Material border
authoring and remove the extra paint child plus its dependent host geometry as
one reviewed change. Do not correct sibling placement with another offset.
Proof commits: `1592ce3` (source structure) and `5c56000` (public reduction).
The six evidence/inventory checks for the reduction pass; the two browser tests
still fail in each run. No canonical attribution or full output parity claim is
made by this handoff addition.

Handoff addition verification:
`node --test tests/material-parity/sort-focus-structure.spec.mjs tests/material-parity/sort-focus-border-public-proof.spec.mjs`
passed **4/4**, exit 0, 1,694.4133ms, with no skips or cancellations. This
replays source and retained failing browser evidence, not new renderer fixes.

## Integration and completion gates

No implementation has been performed by this handoff. The main audit still has
unresolved classifications and pending canonical integration; proposed group
reductions must not be reported as accepted current counts. Do not roll back
unrelated work or alter a running verification job's inputs.

For each future fix: preserve the failing equivalent-input reproduction, test
the general correction at its owner, restore associated compensations with
explicit input review, verify the actual served package, then commit the bounded
result. Verify nearby compositions rather than closing every similar symptom
from a single primitive pass.

Audit completion still requires the full discovered audit harness and complete
unfiltered enforced parity matrix. Current package scripts define
`npm run parity:release:check` as general, TTS and Material enforced gates in
sequence. If an earlier gate prevents a later gate from executing, run and
record the missing constituent separately; do not count it as executed. Retain
honest output failures without loosening thresholds or implementing fixes under
audit scope. Input classifications, evidence-verifier passes and output-parity
results must remain separately reported.

## Handoff verification

The existing evidence suites were replayed unchanged; no extra documentary
validator or duplicate machine dataset was added:

```text
node --test --test-concurrency=1 tests/material-parity/button-held-update-evidence.spec.mjs tests/material-parity/public-range-drag-evidence.spec.mjs tests/material-parity/public-range-travel.spec.mjs tests/material-parity/public-range-paint.spec.mjs tests/material-parity/public-vertical-align-evidence.spec.mjs tests/parity/material-audit-harness-inventory.spec.mjs
```

Result: **24/24**, exit **0**, no failures, skips, cancellations or TODOs, in
**29,845.5369ms**. Log:
`artifacts/material-parity/field-host-flow-input-audit/root-cause-handoff-verification.log`.
These are evidence-replay and negative-control passes; the underlying public
rendering/interaction failures remain retained and unfixed. This is not a fresh
browser capture, the complete audit harness, or enforced output-parity acceptance.
